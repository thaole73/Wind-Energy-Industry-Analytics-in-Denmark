# Wind-Energy-Industry-Analytics-in-Denmark
Wind power has played an important role in the global transition toward sustainable and renewable energy
sources. Unlike fossil fuels, wind power is a clean and inexhaustive resource as it is freely available and
abundant across the globe. Both in Europe and worldwide, the wind power industry has been growing
at a fast pace. In 2021 wind electricity generation increased by a record 273 TWh (up 17%). This was
55% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and was the highest among all renewable power technologies
(IEA, 2022). The development of wind power helps many countries significantly cut down their carbon
footprint and achieve their emission reduction targets while reducing their dependence on fossil fuels as well
as vulnerability to energy price fluctuations and supply disruption. In Europe, Denmark had the highest
share of wind with an impressive 55% in 2022, followed by Ireland with 34%. The UK became the country
with the third highest share of wind with 28% (Wind Europe, 2023). In this report, I will focus on exploring,
analyzing, and forecasting the wind power production in Denmark. The report aims to answer the question
“How do weather factors and climate change impact wind power production in Denmark?”
In the first part of the report, I will discuss about the background of wind power industry and regulation
in Denmark and develop the hypothesis relating to research question based on existing literatures. Then,
I will implement exploratory analysis on dataset and forecast the wind power production with different
forecasting models including SARIMA, Dynamic Hamonic Regression Model, Linear Regression, Random
Forest, and Regression with Arima Error. The relationship between the weather-related factors and wind
energy production is also explored using regression model. Lastly, the results and limitations of this project
will be discussed.
